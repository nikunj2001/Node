Asynchrous Approach
does not effect other code.
does not stop anoter line bcoz of its timeout
it is bcoz of event-Loop
Call-BAck and promises
CallBack-
are used to solve the problem of async calls
that is it completes the first task later and second task
first which is not good sometimes
login before register
display user data before register
higher order function -function inside function
Callback hell occurs in this situtation
to get out of this we use promises
Async await is further better than promise
it is asynchronous but seems synchronous
await makes other functions wait until it completes itself
